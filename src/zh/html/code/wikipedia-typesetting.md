**Typesetting** is the composition of
[text](/wiki/Written_language "Written language") by means of arranging
physical [types](</wiki/Sort_(typesetting)> "Sort (typesetting)")
^[\[1\]](#cite_note-typesetting_random_house_dictionary_definition-1)^
or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called
[sorts](</wiki/Sort_(typesetting)> "Sort (typesetting)") in mechanical
systems and [glyphs](/wiki/Glyphs "Glyphs"){.mw-redirect} in digital
systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language\'s
[orthography](/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") for visual display.
Typesetting requires one or more [fonts](/wiki/Font "Font") (which are
widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for
[typefaces](/wiki/Typeface "Typeface")). One significant effect of
typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily,
making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.
