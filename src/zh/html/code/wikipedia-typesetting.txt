Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical types[1]
or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called sorts in
mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered
according to a language's orthography for visual display. Typesetting requires
one or more fonts (which are widely but erroneously confused with and
substituted for typefaces). One significant effect of typesetting was that
authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for
copiers who have not gained permission.[2]
